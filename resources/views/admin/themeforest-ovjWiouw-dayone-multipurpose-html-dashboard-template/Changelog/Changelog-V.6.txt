----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Completely changed Folder Structure for Simplified Development and Production.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Here the project is divided into src and dist.
	First, please understand the difference between the "src" and "dist" folders. Here, src stands for source and is the raw code before concatenation or some other compilation, which has been used to read or edit the code. dist stands for distribution, and this is the concatenated version that is actually used on production sites.
	So here, only the dist folder is used for production, and src is used for development. So any changes made during development in the src folder need to be run the related "gulp" command to effect the same changes in the dist folder. Because the changes made in the src folder will reflect in the dist folder when you run the gulp command.
