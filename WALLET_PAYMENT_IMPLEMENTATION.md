# Wallet Payment System Implementation

## Overview
Complete wallet payment system implementation for authenticated users with deposit wallet balance > 0.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Frontend Features (Checkout Page)
- **Wallet Payment Option**: Shows only for authenticated users with `deposit_wallet > 0`
- **Balance Display**: Shows current wallet balance in payment method selection
- **Real-time Validation**: JavaScript checks if wallet balance is sufficient for order total
- **Dynamic Status Messages**: Success/warning messages based on balance sufficiency
- **Payment Method Priority**: Wallet payment appears first if available, otherwise COD is default

### 2. Backend Features (CheckoutController)

#### Store Method:
- **Validation**: Added `wallet_payment` to accepted payment methods
- **Authentication Check**: Verifies user is logged in for wallet payments
- **Balance Verification**: Checks sufficient wallet balance before processing
- **Atomic Wallet Deduction**: Uses `decrement()` for thread-safe balance deduction
- **Payment Status**: Sets `payment_status = 'paid'` and `status = 'confirmed'` for wallet payments
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs wallet payment processing for debugging

#### ProcessOrder Method:
- **Same validation and processing logic** as store method
- **Consistent payment status handling**: `payment_status = 'paid'` for wallet payments
- **Payment details consistency**: Sets payment_details status to 'paid' for wallet payments

### 3. User Experience Flow

1. **User Login Check**: System checks if user is authenticated
2. **Wallet Balance Check**: Displays wallet payment option only if `deposit_wallet > 0`
3. **Order Total Validation**: JavaScript validates sufficient balance before allowing order placement
4. **Instant Payment Confirmation**: Wallet payments are immediately confirmed (paid status)
5. **Balance Deduction**: Amount is instantly deducted from user's deposit wallet
6. **Order Confirmation**: Order status is set to 'confirmed' for immediate processing

### 4. Security Features
- **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in users can use wallet payment
- **Fresh Balance Check**: System reloads user data to prevent race conditions
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses database-level decrement to prevent double-spending
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multiple validation layers on both frontend and backend

### 5. Database Impact
- **Orders Table**: Wallet payments have `payment_status = 'paid'` and `status = 'confirmed'`
- **Users Table**: `deposit_wallet` is decremented by order amount
- **Payment Details**: JSON field stores wallet payment information

### 6. Logging & Debugging
- **Wallet Balance Checks**: Logged with before/after balances
- **Payment Processing**: Detailed logs for wallet deduction process
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for insufficient balance or authentication issues

## Usage Examples

### Sufficient Balance:
```
Available Balance: ৳5,000.00
Order Total: ৳2,500.00
Status: ✅ Sufficient Balance! You can complete this order with wallet payment.
```

### Insufficient Balance:
```
Available Balance: ৳1,500.00
Order Total: ৳2,500.00
Status: ⚠️ Insufficient Balance! You need ৳1,000.00 more.
```

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend JavaScript:
```javascript
function checkWalletBalance() {
    const walletBalance = {{ auth()->user()->deposit_wallet ?? 0 }};
    const orderTotal = parseFloat(document.getElementById('total-amount').textContent.replace(/[৳,]/g, ''));
    // Balance validation and UI update logic
}
```

### Backend Validation:
```php
if ($request->payment_method === 'wallet_payment') {
    $user = Auth::user();
    if (!$user) {
        throw new \Exception('Authentication required for wallet payment');
    }
    
    if ($user->deposit_wallet < $finalTotal) {
        throw new \Exception('Insufficient wallet balance...');
    }
    
    // Deduct amount atomically
    User::where('id', $user->id)->decrement('deposit_wallet', $finalTotal);
}
```
